### INTRODUCTION:
Facial expressions serve as a powerful form of non-verbal communication, conveying emotions and intentions that are often difficult to articulate verbally. Recognizing these expressions automatically through technology has become increasingly important, with applications ranging from human-computer interaction to mental health assessment. Facial Emotiom Detection involves several 
stages including pre-processing, face detection, feature extraction, and expression classification. In this project we applied various deep learning methods (convolutional neural networks) to identify the key seven human emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise and neutral.
